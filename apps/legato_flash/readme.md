# Legato Benchmark

The legato_flash demonstration application serves as an external memory programmer to flash the off-chip non-volatile memory.

The legato_flash demonstration application serves as an external memory programmer to flash the off-chip non-volatile memory with the resources held on an Memory Storage Device (MSD), such as a USB or a SD card, which can then be accessed by other applications saving on-chip memory for other programs and resources.

The application legato_quickstart_external_resources in MPLAB Harmony needs to use preloaded images/fonts from QSPI flash external non-volatile memory. This would require legato_flash to flash the required image and font resources onto the QSPI flash. Refer to legato_quickstart_external_resources for usage model information.

This demonstration runs on:
