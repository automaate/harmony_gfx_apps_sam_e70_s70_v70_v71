![](./../../docs/html/legato_adventure.png)

This application demonstrates parallax and sprite animation capabilities using the graphics library. The application first launches a splash screen highlighting basic motion capability supported by the graphics library then transistions to the main screen.

When running the application, the user can interface with it via capacitive single-fingered touch and swiping gestures. The primary mode is presented in a mobile-game like style. In addition, two other features demonstrated by this application includes the circular gauge widget and the ability to display updating text at a high update rate (showing the score count). The lamb sprite character is animated by rapidly blitting frames of the animation character with slight position changes.
